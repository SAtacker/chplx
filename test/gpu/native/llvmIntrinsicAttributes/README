The purpose of this test is to demonstrate that the attributes that clang
applies when the intrinsic llvm.nvvm.read.ptx.sreg.tid.x is used is the same
attributes that will be applied when Chapel uses the intrinsic. 

Why do we care?

The assumption is the clang knows best what attributes should be placed on this
intrinsic. Unfortunately I haven't figured out a way to construct the
declaration to this intrinsic function by calling out to the Clang API, so I
end up manually constructing the LLVM IR for it. For now everything matches as
we expect\want, but if Clang updates to give more specific \ better attributes
it would be nice to have this test fail to inform us.
