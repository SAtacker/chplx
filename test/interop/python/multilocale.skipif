 Multilocale interoperability requires ZMQ
 Installation of the ZMQ library is detected with the find_library function,
 which looks for the appropriate dynamic library (e.g. libzmq.so).
 Note that if the dynamic library is found, this test assumes that the
 header and static library are available. Can be overridden with
 `CHPL_TEST_NO_ZMQ=True`
